# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Nice to meet you!

I am Adhi Nugroho, a Full-stack Web Developer with over 3 years of experience, I enjoy challenges and am always eager to explore new technologies. My career began in 2021 during an internship at PT DIENG CYBER INDONESIA, where I developed a waste management platform (bank sampah).

Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, including an e-library platform, class booking systems, attendance tracking systems, and travel ticket booking applications. I am skilled in backend development with Laravel, building modern and responsive frontends, and integrating real-time interactive features.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise in Node.js for backend development and have a deep interest in blockchain technology. With a commitment to clean code and continuous improvement, I strive to create high-quality software that aligns with business goals.
